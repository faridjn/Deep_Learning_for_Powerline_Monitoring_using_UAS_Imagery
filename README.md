# Deep_Learning_for_Powerline_Monitoring_using_UAS_Imagery
 The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning-based approach for automated damage detection in distribution power line inspection images. The proposed method will be trained on a dataset of high-resolution images labeled with different types of damage and will be able to identify and classify electric transmission equipment.
